# Teachable_RockSciPap

simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** hand gesture recognition model 

created using **Teachable Machine** by Google.

---

## Main Features

- Uses webcam images to recognize three hand gestures: **Rock**, **Scissors**, and **Papers**.
- Trained with multiple photos of each gesture to improve accuracy.
- Shows real-time prediction results with confidence percentages.
- Easy to train and test without coding knowledge.

---

## How It Works

1. You train the model by providing photos of your hand showing each gesture.
2. The model learns to distinguish the gestures using machine learning.
3. After training, the model can recognize gestures from live webcam input.
4. The output shows which gesture is detected with the percentage of confidence.

## Example

- The preview image shows a hand showing the **Papers** gesture.
- The output correctly identifies "Papers" with 100% confidence.
- Other gestures ("Rock" and "Scissors") show near zero confidence.

---

## Usage Tips

- Make sure your hand is clearly visible in front of the camera.
- Train the model with many different photos under good lighting.
- Test in real-time to see the gesture predictions.
